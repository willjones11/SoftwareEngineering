<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<!--[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)-->

This project was created in Georgia State University Software Engineering class. We were tasked with creating a product following the software engineering guideline. It is are pleasure to introduce 
RIC-BOT (Reccomendation Interactive Chatbox). RIC-BOT's objective is to help clients pin down what they should have to eat.
<br>
Are you indecisive? Or are you looking to spice up your life with a new recipe? Then RIC-BOT is for you. RIC-BOT engages the client by asking questions to narrow down and offer a suggestion based on client respones.
